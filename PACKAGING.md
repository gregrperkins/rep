## npm

Need a plovr recipe that clones from svn/git, or at least unpacks the jar.
So that we can use custom library versions or whatnot.

Can we pass a parameter to npm modules that are downloaded, or would we need
to rely on forks for that kind of thing?

## Closure Library

Fewer warnings in ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS/VERBOSE would be nice.
I'd really like to use "[treat-warnings-as-errors](http://plovr.com/options.html#treat-warnings-as-errors)".

It would be nice to be able to add custom jsdoc-like syntax,
which would be selectively ignored,
without compromising warnings for legitimate misspellings.

## Plovr

[Plovr][plovr] is good. Plovr is great. Here's what more I want from it.

#### SoyWeb

[SoyWeb][soyweb] should be run concurrently with the rest of the plovr server, on the same port.

#### Docs

Doesn't seem to support all the jsdoc directives. Investigation TODO(gregp).

#### Tests

Plovr doesn't seem to run multiple tests in advanced mode.
If I split the unit test file,
then [/all][all_tests] will do the right thing for a raw mode collective run.
Each soy file will only be able to load one compiled JS file
with plovr warnings and advanced optimizations.

So we'll create a soy file and a module for each test we want to run with AO.
Ideally these should be autogenerated and served from any ``*_test.js`` file.

#### Language

Plovr should be written in node. This would be a bit of a project. It should maintain [plovr config format][plovr_config].

Also while we're dreaming, [jscomp][jscomp] should be written in node.

Because everything about Javascript should be written in Javascript.
